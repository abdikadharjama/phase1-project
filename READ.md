Toy Collection Web Application
Problem Statement
Many people collect toys as a hobby, and managing a toy collection can be a challenging task. Keeping track of various toys, their details, and the ability to interact with the collection online can enhance the collector's experience. The Toy Collection web application aims to address this issue by providing a platform for users to manage and display their toy collections efficiently.

Objectives/Features of the Application
The Toy Collection web application will have the following key objectives and features:

Display Toy Collection: Users can view their entire toy collection, including toy names, images, and the number of likes.

Like and Dislike Toys: Users can interact with each toy by liking or disliking it. This feature allows users to express their preferences for individual toys.

Add New Toys: Users can add new toys to their collection by providing toy names and image URLs. The application will generate a unique ID for each new toy.

Delete Toys: Users can remove toys from their collection. Deletion will be based on the unique ID assigned to each toy.

Styling and User Experience: The application will have an attractive and user-friendly interface to enhance the collector's experience.

Persistent Data Storage: Toy collection data will be stored in a JSON file on the server, ensuring that the collection remains intact even after refreshing or closing the browser.

Responsive Design: The application will be responsive to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile platforms.

App Implementation
The Toy Collection web application will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The codebase will consist of the following components:

HTML: To structure the web page, including displaying toy data and user input forms.
CSS: To style the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: To handle user interactions, manage toy data, and update the user interface dynamically.
Interactivity

Users can delete toys from their collection, removing them from both the interface and the data store.
Source of Information
The toy data for the application will be loaded from a JSON file named "toys.json" hosted on the server. This JSON file will contain an array of toy objects, each with a unique ID, name, image URL, and likes count.

Challenges
